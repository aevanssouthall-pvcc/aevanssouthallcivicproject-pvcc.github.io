	<h2>Civic Topic:</h2>
        <p>We often think in terms of how computer technology has changed our society. Many argue, however, that 
          this technology has often kept changes from occurring by allowing old systems to survive and, in some cases, 
          become more entrenched. For example, would a central government's role in society have survived without computer 
          technology? To what extent would centralized authority be present today had computer technology not been available? 
          To what extent would we be better or worse off without computer technology?</p>
