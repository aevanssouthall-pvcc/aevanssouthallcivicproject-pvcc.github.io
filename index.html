		<h2>Overview</h2>
        	<p>
		It is inarguable that the advancement of computer technology has changed society indefinitely. This technology opened up so many 
		job markets in every single career field, while also paving the way for many other technological advancements. As great as these things 
		are, many argue that computer technology has its limitations, which has prevented us from making even more monumental changes in the world. 
		Is this true? To what extent would we be better or worse off without the creation of computer technology?
		</p>
		<p>Topic is derived from <a href="https://platform.virdocs.com/read/2229317/39/#/4/2[P70010149900000000000000000018C5]">Question #3 from Chapter 2</a> of Brookshear Textbook</p>
		<p>Let's lay out some of the <a href="https://birimler.atauni.edu.tr/yabanci-diller-yuksekokulu/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/Computer-Engineering-Reading-Comprehension-7.pdf">pros and cons</a> of computer technology.</p>
		<h2>PROS:</h2>
		<p>Here is a list of several pros that have come from the development of computer technology:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Internet</li>
			<li>Job Opportunities</li>
			<li>Productivity</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Now let's break each of these topics down</p>
		<h3>The Internet:</h3>
		<p>
		The introduction of the internet is one of the most monumental developments caused by computers. The ability to connect to anyone,
		anywhere has changed the way people view the world. Additionally, the Internet allows for vast amounts of information to be easily 
		accessible to ordinary people. Whether it be scholarly articles, wikipedia, or youtube, people can find information on seemingly endless topics using the internet
		</p>
		<h3>Job Opportunities:</h3>
		<p>
		The development of computer technology has also expanded the job market exponentially. Every career field can benefit from the use 
		of computers, whether it be retail cashiers, engineers, or marketers, the implications of computers are endless. An <a href="https://www.nber.org/digest/sep97/how-has-computer-use-changed-labor-market">article</a> written by the 
		National Bureau of Economic Research states that, “The rapid spread of computer technology in the workplace may explain as much as 30 to 50 
		percent of the extra growth in the demand for more-skilled workers since 1970”
		</p>
		<h3>Productivity:</h3>
		<p>
		Computers have also streamlined productivity in many fields. A great example of this is a calculator, which is able to immediately solve math problems, 
		massively saving time. Computers are also great for making databases or analysing large amounts of data quickly, allowing companies to automate 
		otherwise tedious processes, massively increasing productivity.
		</p>
		<h2>CONS:</h2>
		<p>While the implications of computer technology have many positives, it is also very important to mention and understand some of the 
		negative effects the technology can have. Here is a list of some of those negative effects:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Cybercrime</li>
			<li>Technological Obsolescence</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Cybercrime</h3>
		<p>
		With the rise of computer technology, there has also been a rise in malicious activity. With computers often being 
		used to store and transmit sensitive information, hackers and other malicious people seek to prey on computer users for 
		their own personal gain. For example, phishing attempts are becoming more and more commonplace, targeting gullible people to 
		click on links that download viruses or potentially scamming them. With the rise of computers, its important to know the risk you’re at while using the technology.
		</p>
		<h3>Technological Obsolescence</h3>
		<p>
		As society becomes more and more reliant on computers in everyday life, <a href="https://www.leanix.net/en/wiki/trm/what-is-technology-obsolescence">technological obsolescence</a> as a risk becomes more and more real. 
		For the past few decades, we have been building our infrastructure on technology that quickly becomes outdated and a potential security 
		risk. For example, in the medical field, it is very important to avoid technological obsolescence. As medical technologies quickly advance, 
		patient data is put at risk.
		</p>
		<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
		<p>
		Let's look back to the original question of “to what extent would we be better or worse off without the creation of computer technology?” 
		While yes, there would be no more worry over security risks or the implications of technological obsolescence, we would also lose ease of 
		access to near infinite amounts of information, as well as the interconnectivity provided by the Internet. We would lose all of the increases 
		in productivity computers are able to provide, while also scaling down the jobs that computers gave us access to. I believe that, ultimately, 
		we would be worse off without the creation of computers.
